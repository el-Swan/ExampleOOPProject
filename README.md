# ExampleOOPProject
An example project displaying skills in object oriented programming and data structures, created when taking a class in data structures and algorithms

This is an example project from my data structures course, covering the following topics in c++
  - Various data structures
    - Arrays
    - Vectors from the c++ standard library
    - A custom doubly linked list
  - Object oriented programming 
  - Inheritance 

The project is a tool used to store a polynomial object in a data structure, read from a text file. It can then be printed or evaluated.
Example usage for the file can be found in example.txt. The first number is the coefficient, and the second is the value of the exponent. More than 
one polynomial can be added by entering multiple values like those found in the example file. 

This program may be run in interactive or automated mode. Usage for interacive is simply to execute the executable. To run the program in 
an automated mode that runs all data structures, execute the program, followed by the name of the file and value to evaluate the polynomial for. 
EX) ./app example.txt 3
